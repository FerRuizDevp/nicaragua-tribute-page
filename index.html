                        <p>Nicaragua is the largest country in Central America by area and the least densely populated. Nicaraguans (or "Nicas" as they are often called) like to refer to their country as the <i>"país de lagos y volcanes"</i>; the country of lakes and volcanoes. And those are indeed striking features as Nicaragua contains the largest freshwater body in Central America, Lake Nicaragua or Cocibolca. Inside Lake Nicaragua the famed Volcano Concepcion on Ometepe rises to about a mile in altitude, but other volcanoes such as Momotombo or Mombacho are also impressive.</p>

Each town has its own dish, drink, and dessert, the same for each occasion, festivities, or season of the year. Some of the best known are the gallopinto, nacatamal, vigorón, rundown, among others. The cuisine is a mixture of indigenous, Spanish, and Creole cuisine. Over the years these three cuisines have influenced each other and blended into what the cuisine is today. The traditional cuisine usually varies on the Pacific and Caribbean coast; the main difference is the cuisine of the Caribbean coast predominately uses seafood and coconut. One of the most staple foods is corn; it has been the base in the cuisine of Nicaragua since pre-Colombian times. It is used widely in a variety of dishes, such as drinks, main dishes, snacks, and sweets. Rice and beans are also a staple in Nicaraguans diet. A common dish made with these two items is Gallo Pinto; this dish is eaten for breakfast and usually served with eggs.</p>
